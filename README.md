# Gamelab Worklogs Helper
A tool to help write worklogs for GameLab at Nord University.

Worklogs are often done at the end of the day, which can lead to guessing the time spent on tasks. With this tool, simply write down your task and click **Start** - the application will take care of tracking the hours for you.
